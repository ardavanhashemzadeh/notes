From https://github.com/libapps/libapps-mirror/blob/master/nassh/doc/faq.txt#L460:


  If you know the index of the offending host entry (it's usually reported
  by ssh if the connection fails) you can open the JavaScript console and


  type...

     term_.command.removeKnownHostByIndex(index)



  Replace index with the numeric, one-based host index.



  If you don't know the index, or you'd like to clear all known hosts,

  type...


     term_.command.removeAllKnownHosts()
